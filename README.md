# JS-Portfolio-Project

The purpose of this API is to aggregate news stories from reliable sources. The news stories will be aggregated in real time, and their content will be based on topics that are trending on Twitter.

The main page shows a list of links that users must follow. When a user clicks a link, the resulting page consists of links to related news. The user must choose the save button at the top of the page to persist the collection that the app generated. A user can delete or generate from that topic again by revisiting the page and choosing the corresponding option.
